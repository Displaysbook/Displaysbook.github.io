Slide 1: Story Overview
Hello everyone! Today, I’ll be sharing two versions of the Cinderella story: Disney’s Cinderella and Adelita: A Mexican Cinderella Story. We’ll explore each story’s unique cultural background, plot structure, and themes.

Disney’s Cinderella is set in a classic European fairytale world. Cinderella is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters but, with her Fairy Godmother’s magical help, attends the royal ball, where she wins the prince’s heart.

In contrast, Adelita takes place in rural Mexico, reflecting Mexican culture. Adelita is also mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters, but with the help of her nurse, Esperanza—and without any magic—she attends a grand local celebration and captures the heart of Javier, a young nobleman.

Slide 2: Background Comparison
Disney’s Cinderella features a European royal setting with magical elements that bring fairytale enchantment.
Adelita, on the other hand, is rooted in Mexican village life and traditions, with cultural symbols like Mexican festivals, traditional attire (such as shawls), and rural community elements.
Slide 3: Similarities
Both stories highlight themes of kindness and resilience. Despite hardship and mistreatment, both Cinderella and Adelita remain pure-hearted and determined.
Both stories include an evil stepmother, cruel stepsisters, a virtuous protagonist, and a nobleman who falls in love with her.
During the climactic part of the stories, both characters attend a grand event, catch the attention of the nobleman, and leave behind a clue—a glass slipper or shawl—that leads to their eventual reunion.
Slide 4: Differences
Disney’s Cinderella relies heavily on magical elements, including talking animals and a Fairy Godmother who helps her transform.
Adelita has no magic. Instead, Adelita’s transformation is thanks to her nurse’s support and her own inner strength.
Adelita emphasizes family, heritage, and reality, using cultural motifs rather than magic to move the story forward.
Slide 5: Plot Structure
Both versions follow a classic plot structure:

Beginning: Both Cinderella and Adelita live with their fathers, who eventually pass away, leaving them under their stepmother’s rule.
Rising Conflict: The protagonist suffers mistreatment but hears about an upcoming event—the royal ball for Cinderella and a grand fiesta for Adelita.
Climax: Both attend the event in disguise, capturing the nobleman’s attention. Due to time constraints, they abruptly leave, leaving a glass slipper or shawl behind as a clue.
Resolution: The nobleman finds each of them through these clues, leading to a happy ending.
Conclusion
In summary, Disney’s Cinderella and Adelita tell the classic Cinderella story in unique ways. Adelita adds Mexican culture and emphasizes resilience, kindness, and familial bonds without relying on magic. Both stories, however, celebrate the power of goodness and courage, showing how they prevail across different cultures.
